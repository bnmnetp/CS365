In this first homework assignment you will build a simple homepage for yourself.  The homepage should be written using html in a text editor.  No WYSIWIG tools allowed!!  Your home page should have the following features:

1. A main page with some basic information about you and at least one image.
2. Three subsidiary pages.  These pages can be information about you, about a hobby you have, about the classes you take, A page of links to other pages that interest you and you want to share with the world.
3. The main page should link to these subsidiary pages.
4. At least one of the pages should have a list of things.

Experiment with a variety of HTML tags.
For this first assignment you don't need to worry about colors and fonts very much, if at all.  In the next assignment we'll use CSS to make the page look all pretty.

To deploy your web page for the world to see you will use github pages. You will need a github account, and you can see the instructions for making your page available to the world [here:](pages.github.com "github pages")

To turn in this assignment you will email me the URL to your page.
