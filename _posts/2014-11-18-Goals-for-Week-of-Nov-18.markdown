### Tuesday

* XKCD -- Fully Flaskified
* WSGI unwrapped
* See:  [Flask Mega Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

### Thursday

* MVC With Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Return to decorators

### Final Projects

* After the Thanksgiving break you will primarily be working on your final projects.  These projects will require you to use Flask, and many of its plugins.  It must be a CRUD appliaction (Create Retrieve Update Delete) using the database.   You must work with a partner.  You will demonstrate your final application during our final exam time.

* Some ideas:
  * CookBook / Recipe Collection
  * Textbook exchange
  * Gradebook
  * Skills connection - connect locals with students looking to make money
  * Bookmark collector / rater
  
*  The **minimum** requirements:
  * Non-trivial database -- ex, at least three tables related in some way.
  * Multiple views
  * Use of forms
  * Use of templates and a good looking design (you may adopt a template)
