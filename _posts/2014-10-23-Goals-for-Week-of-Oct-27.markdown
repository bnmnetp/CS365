### Tuesday

* Work on Mashups

### Thursday

* Mashup Presentations
  * You have a total of 10 minutes
  * 5-7 minutes for your presentation with a couple minutes for questions
  * Work this out and practice ahead of time.  Don't wing it, this is an important part of your grade.  Doing a good technical demo is an important skill.
  * Introduction 
    - Introduce yourself(s)
    - What inspired you to do the mashup you are describing?
    - What problem does it solve?
    - Why would others want to use this?
  * Demonstration
    - Show us how it works
  * Technology
    - Which API's did you use?
    - What technical challenges did you face?
  * Questions
    - leave a couple minutes for questions
    
And the order of presentations as determined by random.shuffle is:
    
    import random

    groups = ['miriam', 'Aren and Michael', 'Ellen and Cadence', 
    'Dichha and Bailey', 'Dorjee and Lucas', 'Josh', 'Isaiah and Kirby', 'Scott and Ehren', 'Jon and Juan', 'Brennen', 'Bjorn']

    random.shuffle(groups)
    print groups
    
    ['Isaiah and Kirby', 'Ellen and Cadence', 'Scott and Ehren', 'Jon and Juan', 'Aren and Michael', 'Dorjee and Lucas', 'Dichha and Bailey', 'Brennen', 'miriam', 'Josh', 'Bjorn']
