Class Requirements: 
===================

Participation
-------------

“The teacher’s job is to design learning experiences, not primarily to
impart information” This is going to be an experiential class, I’ll
lecture some and try to explain some big picture stuff but, I’ve learned
everything I know in this area by doing stuff. I expect you to be
engaged and to ask questions and do stuff. If you stop at the bare
minimum of what I ask you to do for any particular assignment you’ll be
missing an opportunity.

Homework
--------

You will have at least weekly homework assignments, sometimes more
frequently when they are easier.

Midterm Mashups

The mid-term mashup will be a substantial part of your grade. You will
need to design and implement a mashup, then you’ll present a demo of it
to the class when it is all done. Many of today’s successful web
businesses started out as simple mashups. If you desire you can work
with one other person on the mid-term.

-   Create a web page/pages that utilize one or more Web APIs

-   Built with Javascript, CSS, and HTML

-   Examples of available APIs

-   Google Documents, Maps, Calendar, etc.

-   Twitter, Facebook

-   Amazon, Evernote, Dropbox, RTM, tweedledo

-   Movies, Music, Books, ...

-   1000’s of others

-   Combine one or more of these web services to create your own cool
    service

Final Project
-------------

Later in the semester you will need to devise a final project. This
project will make use of the web development framework we’ve used in
class, or you could venture out and use one of the many other web
frameworks (Django, Ruby on Rails, Groovy on Grails, Google App Engine,
etc.) You can work in a group of up to 3. You will need to write up a
formal proposal for this project and have it approved by me before
starting. You and your group will present the project to the class in
the last week of the course.
